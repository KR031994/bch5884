				Nanoparticles for Application in Vaccines</h1></div>
	

	<p style="color:blue;font-family:Comic Sans MS;">Vaccine development in modern times has been able to fruitfully exploit the structural features and other properties that goes into making a nanoparticle. Scientists have throughout ages tried to strategize increasing vaccine potency by conjugating antigen to carrier proteins. Many of our childhood and highly effective vaccines have in fact had polysaccharide conjugates. Malarial vaccine development has advanced through time in leaps and bounds and currently different recombinant subunit proteins found at various stages in the life cycle of a malarial parasite are being tested as potential vaccines. Immune responses of peptide antigens are greatly improved by self-assembled peptide nanoparticles.</p>
	<p style="color:blue;font-family:Comic Sans MS;">Low yield and lack of reproducibility has so far been a great hindrance to protein conjugate vaccine development. There was therefore, a need to come up with an efficient process to prepare characterized conjugates for pre-clinical studies, which could be scaled up later as needed. A practical synthetic method for producing soluble protein nanoparticles composed of one or two proteins, prepared using thioether chemistry was devised. Examples include recombinant malarial antigens Pfs25, CSP and AMA1 with or without inclusion of EPA as a carrier. Future research in this area involves determining the reproducibility and efficacy of this strategy of chemical crosslinking to form protein nanoparticles in case of a human vaccine, particularly against malaria.</p>
